# Dockerized_Django

Why?  Containerized Django is hard, frusterating, and makes you want to just go the easy route and start a VM.  If you're running docker, or even researching containerization, you're probably already starting to understand the benefits of containerization.  This project was born out of curiosity for me, to see if I could successfully create a single stack that could successfully host a django project from both development and production environments. 

This stack utilizes a postgres backend and an nginx front end by utilizing the proxy_pass function.
